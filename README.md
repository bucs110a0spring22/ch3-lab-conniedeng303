## SUMMARY:
 For Part A, I used the random import to pick a random value for the turtles to use to go forward. I used the random import to pick a random value from 1 to 101. I used a for function to pick a random value ten times.

 For part B, I used a nested for loop to a) clear and reset the turtle back to its original position, and then b) actually create shapes with different sides. >
